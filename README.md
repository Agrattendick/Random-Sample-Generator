# Random Sample Generator
This is a simple program that generates a random sample when given a population size and the desired number of samples. 

It verifies that the sample needed is smaller than the given population, and also checks for duplicates to ensure that the required sample inculdes unique values.

The random sample is output as a csv file. 

## To Do:
The first version of the program is an .ipynb file through Jupyter Notebook. The next goal is running it as a .py file.
